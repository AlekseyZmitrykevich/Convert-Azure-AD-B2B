Member. A user expects to have access to internal-only sites. This user is not considered an external collaborator. This will be important when trying to exercise rights that come with privileged roles like Global Administrator.

Guest. indicates a user who isnâ€™t considered internal to the company. This type of user will have restricted access and lookup rights in the directory
